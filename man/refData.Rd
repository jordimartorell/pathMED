\title{Example of reference gene expression datasets}
\format{
An object of class \code{"list"} containing eight objects
(dataset1-4 and metadata1-4). Each dataset is a matrix of normalized gene
expression values (genes in rows, samples in columns). Each metadata is a
dataframe with two columns: samples and group.
}
\usage{
data(refData)
}
\description{
refData contains processed gene expression data from four datasets,
including Systemic Lupus Erythematosus patients and healthy controls.
Raw data for each dataset were downloaded from NCBI GEO
(GSE65391, GSE45291, GSE61635, and GSE72509, respectively).
Platform-dependent preprocessing was performed following established
guidelines (Martorell-Marug√°n et al., 2021). Gene expression data were
log2-transformed, and probe sets were annotated to gene symbols.
To reduce computational cost in examples, 20 patient and 10 control
samples were randomly selected from each dataset.
