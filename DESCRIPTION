Description:   PathMED is a collection of tools to facilitate precision medicine studies
  with omics data (e.g. transcriptomics). Among its funcionalities, genesets
  scores for individual samples may be calculated with several methods.
  These scores may be used to train machine learning models and to predict 
  clinical features on new data. For this, several machine learning
  methods are evaluated in order to select the best method based on internal 
  validation and to tune the hyperparameters. Performance metrics and a 
  ready-to-use model to predict the outcomes for new patients are returned.
